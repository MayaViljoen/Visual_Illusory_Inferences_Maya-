# Context: 

* The problem is :
(a and b) or c
a 

The fallacy is : People are more likely to choose b
First premise there exist two alternative possibilities: a and b or c
Then given the second premise ‘a’, this creates a question answer dynamic, drawing reasoners to former possibility. 

The question is: Is this fallacy evoked in a purely visual paradigm? 
     What role does language play in this fallacious reasoning? 

Chung et al. showed that such visual paradigms induce similar reasoning fallacies & even in a non linguistic paradigm : Question-Answer dynamics are taking place. 


## GOALS:
The goal is to present a visual paradigm conveying the structure of illusory inferences from disjunction. 
In Ana Martin’s research project, we present two paths through which water can flow, using gates to set up a similar logical structure of the two alternative possibilities.  
In this paradigm : The previous issue of asymmetry is addressed with the bridge. 
We shall see, adding evidence that the LHS gate opens, acts as the second premise in our linguistic example. 



The aim of this study : To see whether non linguistic visual paradigms  can trigger reasoning with alternative possibilities// question answer dynamics , ultimately creating a paradigm that can be used to test adults and pre-linguistic infants. 
Predictions: Higher fallacy rate in target trials than in baseline// no controls 
Predict fallacy rates to be lower than linguistic paradigm
New element of participants : simulating forward (paradigm can be applied to babies using eye-tracker)

To see whether non linguistic visual paradigms  can trigger reasoning with alternative possibilities// question answer dynamics 

To create a paradigm that can be used to test adults - and pre linguistic infants 

Predict : Higher fallacy rate in target trials than in baseline// no controls 

Predict: fallacy rates to be lower than linguistic paradigm.

## Welcome text

**Familiarization**

  'You will be presented some videos. Watch them carefully and press continue to move on. '

**FAMILIARIZATION phase: contains 5 scenes - Single branch pipe introducing the gates, the bridge and the occluders. A button CONTINUE will appear on the screen and be active once the movie ended**

* Fam 1: Teaches that, if the path is unobstructed,  water flows from the tap a the top to the bottom 
* Fam 2: Teaches that, if the path is obstructed,  water flow stops until path bridge is removed again
* Fam 3: Teaches that, the bridge (used for purposes of maintaining symmetrical structure) has no influence on the flow of water
* Fam 4: Teaches that, the occluder (for experimental purposes) has no influence on the the underlying mechanisms
* Fam 5: Teaches that, there exists a non-functional gate, whose state can not be changed, obstructing water flow permanently 


Familiarization Trials : 1-5****will b same for this exp
## Condition change between participants.
Mirrored: to avoid the confounding factor of  LHS bias 


## Test Trial: Future: Possibility
**Which Gate do you think will open?**
* J
* K
* I don’t know 

An answer of J adds evidence to visual question answer dynamics taking place.
 An answer of 3: evidence that original version : interpretive// linguistic mechanisms
Is mirroring included?

## No Control: Future:Possibility
**Do you think J/K will open?**
* J
* K
* I dont know

Minimally different from test trial : filter out biases 


Baseline Subtraction: Exclude those that say yes ?

## Yes Control: Future:Possibility
**Do you think J/K will open?**
* Yes
* I dont know 

Exclude those that say no/ add follow up question for those that said I don’t know


# Controls: Accuracy in static controls and yes control animations: static controls presented
