				Story Board Visual Illusory Inferences 


## GOALS:


To see whether non linguistic visual paradigms  can trigger reasoning with alternative possibilities// question answer dynamics 

To create a paradigm that can be used to test adults - and pre linguistic infants 

Predict : Higher fallacy rate in target trials than in baseline// no controls 

Predict: fallacy rates to be lower than linguistic paradigm.

## Welcome text

**Familiarization**

  'You will be presented some videos. Watch them carefully and press continue to move on. '

**FAMILIARIZATION phase: contains 5 scenes - Single branch pipe introducing the gates, the bridge and the occluders. A button CONTINUE will appear on the screen and be active once the movie ended**

* Fam 1: Teaches that, if the path is unobstructed,  water flows from the tap a the top to the bottom 
* Fam 2: Teaches that, if the path is obstructed,  water flow stops until path bridge is removed again
* Fam 3: Teaches that, the bridge (used for purposes of maintaining symmetrical structure) has no influence on the flow of water
* Fam 4: Teaches that, the occluder (for experimental purposes) has no influence on the the underlying mechanisms
* Fam 5: Teaches that, there exists a non-functional gate, whose state can not be changed, obstructing water flow permanently 


Familiarization Trials : 1-5****will b same for this exp
## Condition change between participants.
Mirrored: to avoid the confounding factor of  LHS bias 


## Test Trial: Future: Possibility
**Which Gate do you think will open?**
* J
* K
* I don’t know 

An answer of J adds evidence to visual question answer dynamics taking place.
 An answer of 3: evidence that original version : interpretive// linguistic mechanisms
Is mirroring included?

## No Control: Future:Possibility
**Do you think J/K will open?**
* J
* K
* I dont know

Minimally different from test trial : filter out biases 


Baseline Subtraction: Exclude those that say yes ?

## Yes Control: Future:Possibility
**Do you think J/K will open?**
* Yes
* I dont know 

Exclude those that say no/ add follow up question for those that said I don’t know


 


## Controls: Accuracy in static controls and yes control animations: static controls presented 




## Disjunctive Trial & Target trial  
 
Do we show the outcome here, surely since this is a test trial involving reasoning in terms of past possibility the participant should see the outcome?


**No Control future**
A similar question here, showing the outcome (3 parallel gates)
By representing the outcome but asking a future question, this confuses me, as the particpant is aware that the water has already come through (some sort of past representation), yet must predict whether J is guaranteed to open
